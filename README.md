### Hi there 👋


# 🚀Henry Mishael

**"Frontend Developer | UI Engineer "**
Hello, and welcome to my World.

My name is Henry Mishael and I am a software Engineer with my priority on the Frontend stack.  I like to craft solid and scalable frontend products with great user experiences. I am also highly skilled in progressive enhancement, design systems and UI engineering.
When I'm not building Frontend applications, I'm probably positioned behind an Illustrator artboard adjusting pixels. Immersed in stylesheets tweaking font sizes and contemplating layouts is where you'll find me (~_^). I'm committed to creating fluent user experiences while staying fashionable.
